# SchematicDiagram
Play Factorio with a new skin, Schematic Diagram Style. Has extremely reduced quality graphics for better performance in low end computers.

I have no idea how to use lua, so if someone could help, that would be good. I will try to figure out how to add new textures in the meantime.

To Do:  1. Redo icons
        2. Redo spites
        3. Add combinators
        4. Add chemical plants
        5. Add pipes
        6. Add everything else
